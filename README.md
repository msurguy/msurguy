### Hi there 👋

I'm Maks. I am a design technologist, creative coder, innovator and web developer with wide range of experience. You can learn a lot about me from my website: https://maxoffsky.com

In my spare time I build [community](https://drawingbots.net) of drawing robot enthusiasts and make tools for 2D CNC machines like:

- https://msurguy.github.io/rad-lines/
- https://msurguy.github.io/flow-lines/
- https://msurguy.github.io/cnc-text-tool/
- https://msurguy.github.io/SquiggleCam/

Previously, I created [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/) and dozens of Laravel-powered websites. I also wrote two e-books: [Integrating front-end components with web applications](https://leanpub.com/frontend) and [Laravel: my first framework](https://leanpub.com/laravel-first-framework) 

You can follow me on Twitter where I post dev / design related, inspiring content: https://twitter.com/msurguy

I'd appreciate if you could sponsor my open source work:
