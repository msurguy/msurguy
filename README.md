### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maks. I am a design technologist, creative coder, innovator and web developer with wide range of experience. You can learn a lot about me from my website: https://maxoffsky.com

In my spare time I build [community](https://drawingbots.net) of drawing robot enthusiasts and make tools for 2D CNC machines like:
